## Samples
‚ö†Ô∏è For the samples to work in the editor, ensure that atleast one recording device is connected to your PC/Mac.  

### Simple MicAudioSource Sample
- A gameobject called `My Mic` is placed. It has the `MicAudioSource` component. 
- Another gmeobject called `Sample` has `SimpleMicAudioSourceSample`
    - On start it checks if there are any mic devices available
    - If yes, it takes the first recording device available and starts the recording using `.StartRecording()`
    - Then assigns the device to `MicAudioSource`, which then starts playing the audio
- Play the scene. You should be able to hear your voice in the editor
### Multiple Mics UI Sample
- Run the scene, you should see every mic device connected 
    - On start, all the devices will start recording in parallel and playing back
    - Toggling the checkbox on or off will start or stop the recording for a device
- Prefab `MicDeviceCell` is used to represent one device. The `MicDeviceCell.cs` script handles its UI.
- Check out the `MicDeviceListSample` script to see how the UI has been created

## Note
* Some Xiaomi phones may prevent side loaded APKs from functioning.  
* There is no AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancelletion). If you're trying the samples be sure to use headphones to avoid creating a feedback loop.
